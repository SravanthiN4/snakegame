We're going to build an arcade! The goal is to build your best game possible during this four-class hackathon!

The good news is that you have complete creative control here: the presentation, extra features above the base features, which game you build... it's all up to you. We are providing you with a starting list of games, rough estimates on the difficulty level for each, and some light instructions for each one, but it will be up to you to implement one and provide a personality to it.
